My Daily Codewars!

#### This is my daily codewars for everyday of the week Mon-Friday

## How it's Made:
Tech used: Javascript

I used Javascript for my daily codewars i learned alot of about breaking problems down to their bare elements & deepend my understanding of arrays.

## Optimizations
I'd like to go back and redo alot of these questions alot more efficiently 

## Lessons Learned
This is my first week with codewars & pushing code to git so i will use this as a foundation to learn & grow confident with git as a whole.

## Examples
Take a look at these examples that i have in my own portfolio
